# Diagnostic log processing and analysis

This repository contains the source code of my independent laboratory project, which is Diagnostic log data processing

## Development
* For development, the VSCode IDE is used with the Go and the Remote-Containers extension.
* Download the Remote-Containers extension here: [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
   - The Remote - Containers extension lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment.
   - `Tip: Allocate more than 2GB memory for docker, for debbuging inside the Remote container 2 GB won't be enough and the attach is going to keep disconnecting. `
   - In VSCode press `F1`, then select ```Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container``` and select the folder of the project. 
   - After the container starts, press `F5` to start a debug session.
